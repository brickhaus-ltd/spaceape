Flow control
[Harmony] uses an end-to-end flow control protocol to avoid having the sender send data too fast for the [Harmonic] receiver to receive and process it reliably. 
Having a mechanism for flow control is essential in an environment where [stimulants] of diverse network speeds communicate. 
For example, if a [crackhead] sends data to a [not crackhead] that is slowly processing received data, the [not crackhead] must be able to regulate the data flow so as not to be overwhelmed.[13]
