Q: If a god could make earth and water, man and woman, the stars and the sky all in seven days...


What the fuck is taking so long for heaven?

A: That's a terrible question. Stupid, even.


Genesis [greek] first book of the Torah [hebrew]. The greeks, had a word for the Torah [hebrew] also, it was Pentateuch [greek].
Pentateuch, in english is Five-scrolls [not more-or-less, but maybe a different thing]. The "Bible" is neither hebrew nor greek; its more like babel & nonsense.
The...Heptateuch; get this---Seven-scrolls, thats the entirety of the hebrew "bible" well ok---Add two books but only count one, it's cool fudge the books a bit for our bud Sammyuel, add two more books but only count one -- you know that thing we do now, for a King or two; and whatever you do---don't also count Ruth's book.
So, theirs like you know 9 or 10.."scrolls" and they settled on Enneateuch. We've all heard of  that before right? No & that was a conjectured fabrication earlier.
